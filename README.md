# FinalPorjectFPinCandDS
Final Project in Functional programming in concurrent and distributed systems. Human blood system simulation.

In order to run the program:
1. Download all folders.
2. In each folder, run the 1st command (which opens the erlang shell) in a different terminal (5 terminals in total).
3. Run the 2 remaining commands in the corresponding terminal - IMPORTANT -> you need to activate them all within 15 seconds or it wont work (this is due to the recovery method).
4. From the "head" Gui you control all the functions. in order to creat the initial blood cells you need to press "run"->"start everything".
5. Before running the "random" option, set the system to normal.
6. do not spawn new events when "random" is running (it spawns 20 random events- so wait until it finishes).  

enjoy.
