# FinalPorjectFPinCandDS
This project was created by Tomer Shick and Yonatan Rak
Final Project in Functional programming in concurrent and distributed systems. Human blood system simulation.

In order to run the program on a single computer:
0. The project was created in OTP 22 but also ran on OTP 24 in the lab.
1. Download all folders.
2. In each folder, run the 1st command (which opens the erlang shell) in a different terminal (5 terminals in total).
3. Run the 2 remaining commands in the corresponding terminal - IMPORTANT -> you need to activate them all within 15 seconds or it wont work, we suggest putting the commands on all terminals and then press the "Enter" key on each one (this is due to the recovery method).
4. From the "head" Gui you control all the functions. in order to creat the initial blood cells you need to press "run"->"start everything".
5. Before running the "random" option, set the system to normal.
6. do not spawn new events when "random" is running (it spawns 20 random events- so wait until it finishes).  


*comments to the files are present in the "head" and "hand0" ("hand1", "foot0" and "foot1" are similar to "hand0").

enjoy.





(In order to run on multiple computers you need to find the IP of each computer and then change the Define in each file to be its corresponding IP instead of 127.0.0.1. then run the program.)
